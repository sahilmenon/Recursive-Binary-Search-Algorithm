# Recursive Binary Search Algorithm
## A simple Recursive Binary Search Algorithm implemented in Python

This project was done by me many years ago when I was first learning Python. The recursive binary search algorithm is a searching algorithm for finding the position of an element (target value) in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the search interval is reduced to empty.
 
 This project may seem simple but has various essential concepts such as:

* Data Structures and Algorithms
* Functions
* Operators
* Flow Control
* Data Types
* Console Output
